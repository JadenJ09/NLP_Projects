    "* What is the VIX?\n",
    "  The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) created the VIX (CBOE Volatility Index) to measure the 30-day expected volatility of the US stock market, sometimes called the “fear index”. The VIX is based on the prices of options on the S&P 500 Index and is calculated by aggregating weighted prices of the index’s call and put options over a wide range of strike prices.\n",
